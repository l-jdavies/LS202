<!-- Problems:
  1. Use CSS to set a fixed width on the image of 800 pixels, and center it in the window horizontally.
  2. Using the code from the previous problem, change the width property for img to 100%, and set the max-width property to 800px. The image should expand to fit any container width up to 800 pixels. Resize your browser width and watch how that affects the photograph.
  3. Using the code from the previous problem, set a fixed height on the image of 533 pixels. Resize the browser window and watch how the image dimensions change.
  4. As you can see, having a variable size for one dimension and fixed for the other makes for a container with strange behavior: this one stretches horizontally but remains fixed vertically. Remove the height and update the CSS to ensure the width does not get smaller than 500 pixels.
